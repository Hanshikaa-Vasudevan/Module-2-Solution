<p>
	 Among the many reasons that make Indian food a popular cuisine across the globe, one is the use of aromatic spices that make the meal an absolute treat. Yes, it could also be hot and spicy for some, but if you can get past that then you will find it hard to resist the various kinds of curries and stir-fries that grace the Indian table. Indian cooking offers a beautiful melange of herbs and spices, and if your favourite meat is chicken, then there are many lip-smacking options for you to go all out and indulge from a host of chicken dishes like the classic butter chicken to regional ones like chicken chettinad or chicken 65.

         	<span id="p3">FISH</span>
	<p>
	Basa, salmon, tuna, king fish, red snapper, hilsa, cod - there are so many different varieties of fish in the market, it's easy to confuse one for the other. It's only when you get down to cooking them do you realise that each has a unique flavour profile and cooking technique. It's one of the biggest reasons why home cooks fear this lean protein. After all, the difference between overdone fish fillets and well-done ones is just a few seconds.
